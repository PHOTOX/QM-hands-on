# QM-hands-on
Materials for "Quantum Mechanics: Hands on" lecture at UCT Prague.

All the python codes are available in the `codes` folder with two subfolders: `exercises` and `solutions`.
- `exercises` contains prepared exercise codes which are to be compeleted by students.
- `solutions` contains full codes solving the problems for students as reference.

The plan is to link this GitHub repo to Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization) where the manual will be created.
