# QM-hands-on
Materials for "Quantum Mechanics: Hands on" lecture at UCT Prague. The repository contains the study materials in $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$  and Python codes implementing the discussed topics.

The text is in a $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$ format in the folder `scriptum`. PDF will be uploaded any time a new chapter is finished.

All the Python codes are available in the `codes` folder within two subfolders: `exercises` and `solutions`.
- `exercises` contains prepared exercise codes for students to complete. 
- `solutions` contains completed codes for students as a reference. 
- `applications` contains solutions of the applications in Chapter 6 and 8

These codes are simple and meant for Python beginners. More advanced students are encouraged to create their own codes employing higher programming standards.
