Up to this point, we have taken the time-independent perspective on quantum mechanics, focusing on methods for calculating stationary states of electrons in molecules. In this chapter, we shift to time-dependent quantum mechanics and look at the time evolution of quantum systems. We will focus on simple low-dimensional models and introduce a simple numerical scheme suitable for wave function propagation. The power of simple low-dimensional models resides in the conceptual understanding of time evolution in quantum mechanics: they allow us to examine dynamics such as interference of two wave packets, tunnelling through energy barriers, or reflection of the wave packet on boundaries.

\section{Theoretical background}

The time evolution in quantum mechanics is governed by the \acrfull{tdse},
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar\frac{\dd\psi(x,t)}{\dd t} = \hat{H}(x)\psi(x,t) \, ,
    \label{eq:tdse}
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the imaginary unit, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\psi$ is the wave function, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian, $t$ is time and $x$ represents the position of a quantum particle, such as an electron, proton, or any other particle. The solution of the \acrshort{tdse} can be in general written as
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,t) = \hat{U}(t)\psi(x,0) \, .
    \label{eq:U}
\end{equation}
The operator $\hat{U}$ is called a \textit{propagator} or \textit{time evolution operator}. Application of the propagator to a wave function is equivalent to evolving the wave function from time 0 to time t. The knowledge of the evolution operator is, therefore, elementary for a description of dynamics in quantum systems.

The propagator is easy to find if the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ does not depend on time. Then, we can formally write a solution of equation~\eqref{eq:tdse} in the following form:
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,t) = \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)t} \psi(x,0)\, .
    \label{eq:tdse2}
\end{equation}
Notice that the result resembles the separation of variables for differential equations, only for a equation with operators. Considering the Hamiltonian to be time-independent restricts the validity of equation~\eqref{eq:tdse2} only for systems without any time-dependent interaction such as oscillating electromagnetic field (radiation), collisions between particles, etc. The solution for time-dependent Hamiltonian is somewhat more complicated and will be omitted here.

Comparing equations~\eqref{eq:tdse2} and \eqref{eq:U}, we see that the evolution operator has a simple form of an exponential of the Hamiltonian,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{U}(t) = \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)t} \, .
    \label{eq:U}
\end{equation}
Formally, we now have a propagator containing all information about the time evolution of the system and we can propagate the wave function to an arbitrary time $t$. While this works well on paper, analytical evaluation of the propagator is in practice not a straightforward task for most Hamiltonians. The hindrance lies in the evaluation of the exponential in equation~\eqref{eq:U}.

Let us briefly discuss why analytic evaluation of the exponential of Hamiltonian is a cumbersome task. The exponential of an operator is defined through its Taylor series as
\begin{equation}
    \e^{\hat{A}} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{\hat{A}^l}{l!} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{A}$ is and arbitrary operator. In our case, $\hat{A} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)t$ which leads to the following relation:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{U}(t) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{\hat{H}^l}{l!} \left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} t\right)^l \, .
    \label{eq:U2}
\end{equation}
Considering the Hamiltonian in the standard form,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}(x) = \hat{T} + \hat{V}(x) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\dd^2}{\dd x^2} + V(x)\, ,
    \label{eq:Ham1}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{T}$ represents the kinetic energy operator, $\hat{V}$ stands for the potential energy operator and $m$ is the particle mass, the propagator becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{U}(t) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(\hat{T}+\hat{V})^l}{l!} \left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} t\right)^l \, .
    \label{eq:U3}
\end{equation}
Calculating this propagator requires computing an infinite series of powers of the Hamiltonian, further complicated by the fact that $\hat{T}$ and $\hat{V}$ do not commute. This makes direct evaluation infeasible for most of the potential.

Thus, analytical solutions of the \acrshort{tdse} are used only in model systems, usually when the complete basis of the respective Hilbert space is known. Instead, most time-dependent problems are solved numerically where arbitrary Hamiltonians are possible. 

\section{*Numerical solution: the Split-Operator method}
\textbf{Three steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item pseudospectral basis
    \item fourier method
    \item split operator
\end{enumerate}

We shall introduce a simple pseudospectral method, that represents the wave function on a grid. It means that we will generate an equidistant grid of points representing the coordinate $x$ and then we will represent on that grid. The complicated part will be evaluation of the propagator, which will be done through the Split-Operator method.
\begin{align}
    x &\rightarrow \{x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\} \\
    \psi(x,t) &\rightarrow \{\psi_0, \psi_1, \psi_2, \dots, \psi_N\}
\end{align}
with a fixed $\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}$

Normalization must be numeric using e.g. trapezoidal rule
\begin{equation}
    \langle \psi(x,t) | \psi(x,t) \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x,t)\psi(x,t) \dd x = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{\psi^*_{j-1}\psi_{j-1} + \psi^*_{j}\psi_{j}}{2} \Delta x
\end{equation}

Before we look at how to evaluate the propagator on a grid, we will need to know how to apply the Hamiltonian operator on a grid. Applying the potential energy operator $\hat{V}(x) = V(x)$ is simple. We discretize the potential energy on the $x$-grid
\begin{align}
    V(x) &\rightarrow \{V_0, V_1, V_2, \dots, V_N\}
\end{align}
which leads to 
\begin{align}
    \hat{V}\psi &\rightarrow \{V_0 \psi_0, V_1 \psi_1, V_2 \psi_2, \dots, V_N \psi_N\}
\end{align}

The kinetic energy operator is evaluated using Fourier method in the so-called $k$-space (or momentum space since momentum is $p=\hbar k$). The wave function in the k-space is obtained by \acrfull{ft} $\mathcal{F}$:
\begin{align}
    \psi(k,t) = \mathcal{F}[\psi(x,t)] =\int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x,t) \e^{-ikx}\dd x \, .
\end{align}
and the \acrshort{ft} kinetic operator 

\begin{align}
    \mathcal{F}[\hat{T}\psi(x,t)] &= \mathcal{F}\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\dd^2 \psi(x,t)}{\dd x^2}\right] = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\dd^2 \psi(x,t)}{\dd x^2}  \e^{-ikx}\dd x \stackrel{p.p.}{=} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} i k \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\dd \psi(x,t)}{\dd x} \e^{-ikx}\dd x \notag \\
    &\stackrel{p.p.}{=} \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} k^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x,t) \e^{-ikx}\dd x = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \psi(k,t) \, .
\end{align}
where $p.p.$ signifies integration per partes. 

The evaluation of $\hat{T}\psi(x,t)$ in the momentum space then requires \acrfull{ift} $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$
\begin{align}
    \hat{T}\psi(x,t) &= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left[\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \psi(k,t)\right] \, .
\end{align}
To summarize evaluation of the kinetic operator, we need first to \acrshort{ft} the wave function to the $k$-space, multiply it by $\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, and then \acrshort{ift} back to the position space:
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,t) \stackrel{FT}{\longrightarrow} \psi(k,t) \longrightarrow \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \psi(k,t) \stackrel{IFT}{\longrightarrow} \hat{T}\psi(x,t)
\end{equation}

We will first discretize time into a series of time steps
\begin{align}
    t &= \{t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n\} 
\end{align}

or rather
\begin{equation}
    t_{i+1} = t_i +\Delta t
\end{equation}

and the propagator
\begin{equation}
    \hat{U}(t) = \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)t} = \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)\Delta t} \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)\Delta t} \cdots \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)\Delta t} \, .
    \label{eq:U4}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{T} t} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{\hat{T}^l}{l!} \left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} t\right)^l = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(-k^2)^l}{l!} \left( -\frac{i}{\hbar} t\right)^l =  \e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} k^2 t}\, ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,t) \stackrel{FT}{\longrightarrow} \psi(k,t) \longrightarrow \e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} t} \psi(k,t) \stackrel{IFT}{\longrightarrow} \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{T} t}\psi(x,t)
\end{equation}

propagators:
Either use Trotter formula or in Tannor there is O(T\^3) formula.

\begin{equation}
    \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(x)\Delta t} = \e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}V(x)\Delta t/2}\e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{T}(x)\Delta t}\e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{V}(x)\Delta t/2} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3)
\end{equation}


\section{Code}

The numerical procedure for quantum dynamics described above can be readily implemented in Python or another suitable programming language. Let us start with a few short notes regarding a Python implementation. We will exploit the \python{numpy} library (imported as \python{np}). The \acrlong{ft} can be conveniently performed as
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle2]
np.fft.fft(psi, norm="ortho")
\end{lstlisting}
with \python{psi} being the wave function. Setting \python{norm="ortho"} employs the orthogonal norm. While we could use a different norm, we need to make sure we use the same norm for the \acrshort{ift} to ensure unitarity. The corresponding $k$-space is generated with
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle2]
2*np.pi*np.fft.fftfreq(ngrid, d=dx)
\end{lstlisting}
where we supply the number of grid points (\python{ngrid}) and the distance between two neighbouring points (\python{dx}). The \acrlong{ift} can be calculated similarly: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle2]
f = np.fft.ifft(psi_k, norm="ortho")
\end{lstlisting}

The integration can be achieved with the trapezoidal rule in Python by selecting
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle2]
np.trapz(y=np.conjugate(psi)*psi, x=x)
\end{lstlisting}
The trapezoidal rule is used here to compute the normalization of the wave function or to calculate expectation values by integrating over space.

Since the wave function is a complex function, we will also need to work with complex numbers in Python. Python works with \python{j} as the complex unit. The corresponding data type is called \python{complex}. Thus, creating an initial wave function can look like 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, style=mystyle2]
psi = (2*alpha/np.pi)**0.25*np.exp(-alpha*(x-x0)**2+1j*p0*(x-x0), dtype=complex)
\end{lstlisting}

Follows the incomplete code for quantum dynamics with empty gaps where the students are supposed to define operators and propagate the wave function according to the method description above. The code is prepared in atomic units where $\hbar=1$~a.u. and requires all the input parameters also in atomic units. The span of the $x$-axis, defined by \python{xmin} and \python{xmax}, should be large enough to contain the entire wave packet during propagation. The wave packet should never reach the boundaries defined by \python{xmin} and \python{xmax}. The number of grid points should be sufficiently big to represent the wave function. A few hundred to a few thousand grid points should suffice for simple dynamics. The time step \python{dt} should be significantly smaller than the time scale on which the wave packet evolves, which depends on its mass and potential. Always make sure the energy and norm are conserved during dynamics as they are indicators of a spurious propagation. Decreasing \python{dt} and increasing \python{ngrid} should always improve both energy and norm conservation.

\section{Applications}

\subsection*{Exercise: Squeezed and coherent states of harmonic oscillator}

The harmonic oscillator and Gaussian wave packet are some of the most important objects in quantum mechanics. While the harmonic oscillator is used as the first approximation to many bound Hamiltonians, the Gaussian wave packet is a commonly used basis function in quantum dynamics. There is a special relationship between them: any initial Gaussian wave function, $\psi(x,0)$, propagated in quadratic potential remains Gaussian throughout its evolution. In other words, a Gaussian wave packet evolving in a harmonic oscillator will retain its Gaussian form, with only its position, momentum, and width changing over time.

Gaussian wave packets evolving in harmonic oscillators can be classified into two groups: \textit{coherent} and \textit{squeezed} states. The \textit{coherent} states are characterized by a constant width of the Gaussian during the dynamics, meaning the wave packet preserves its shape while its position and momentum vary. Contrarily, if the Gaussian spreads and contracts (or contracts and spreads) during the dynamics, it is referred to as a \textit{squeezed} state.

In this exercise, we will explore the properties of \textit{coherent} and \textit{squeezed} states. We define the initial Gaussian wave packet as
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,0) = \left(\frac{2\alpha_0}{\pi}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}} \e^{-\alpha_t(x-x_0)^2 +\frac{i}{\hbar}p_0(x-x_0)} \, ,
    \label{eq:qdgauss}
\end{equation}
where $x_0$ and $p_0$ refer to the initial mean position and momentum of the Gaussian, and $\alpha_0$ is the initial Gaussian width. The potential for harmonic oscillator takes the following form:
\begin{equation}
    V = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2 \, .
    \label{eq:qdho}
\end{equation}
The aim is to determine the Gaussian width $\alpha_0$ corresponding to a \textit{coherent} state by trying different values of $\alpha_0$.

\paragraph{Assignment:} Set up the harmonic oscillator from Eq.~\eqref{eq:qdho} and initial Gaussian wave packet from Eq~\eqref{eq:qdgauss} with the following parameters: $m=20$~a.u., $\omega=2$~a.u., $x_0=0$~a.u. and $p_0=20$~a.u. Set up a trial $\alpha_0$ (Hint: try $\alpha_0$ as a factor of $\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}$). Propagate the wave packet for several oscillation and visualize it. If the wave packet contracts in the center of the potential, increase $\alpha_0$. If the wave packet spreads, decrease $\alpha_0$ to approach a coherent state. Iterate that procedure until you find the value of $\alpha_0$ corresponding to the \textit{coherent} state. 

\subsection*{Exercise: Ehrenfest's theorems in harmonic oscillator}

Ehrenfest's theorems provide a connection between classical and quantum dynamics. They represent equations of motion for expectation values of position $\braket{x}$ and momenta $\braket{p}$. For a harmonic oscillator, Ehrenfest's theorems take the following form:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\dd \braket{x}}{\dd t} &= \frac{\braket{p}}{m} \\
    \frac{\dd \braket{p}}{\dd t} &= -\frac{\dd V(\braket{x})}{\dd \braket{x}} \, .
\end{align*}
These equations are equivalent to the classical Newton's equations of motion, only for expectation values of position $\braket{x}$ and momenta $\braket{p}$ instead of classical $x$ and $p$. This exercise aims to verify that the relations above hold true for harmonic oscillator and $\braket{x}$ and $\braket{p}$ follow a classical trajectory. Equally, one can consider a anharmonic potential, e.g. Morse potential, and show that the relations above are not exact.

\paragraph{Assignment:} Choose an arbitrary initial wave function and harmonic potential. Propagate the wave function for several oscillations and calculate the expectation values of position $\braket{x}$ and momenta $\braket{p}$ over time. Compare the calculated values with a classical trajectory with the same initial conditions. The classical trajectory can be obtained by solving Newton's equations of motion. Repeat the same procedure for an anharmonic Morse potential and show that the relation above does not hold. Note that you will probably need to calculate the classical trajectory numerically, for example by a Verlet method.


\subsection*{Exercise: Tunnelling in a double-well potential}

Tunnelling is an ubiquitous phenomenon in quantum world which is difficult to grasp from classical perspective. It plays an important role in chemistry where light atoms, such as protons, can tunnel through energy barriers causing energetically forbidden reactions. This exercise focuses at tunnelling through a double-well potential,
\begin{equation*}
    V = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2(x^4 - x^2) \, .
\end{equation*}
The wave function will be initiated at the edge of the left well, which will send it to the right towards the barrier. Two scenarios are possible. First, the energy of the wave packet is below the barrier. Then, no density should be observed at the other well from classical perspective. Thus, any density observed in the right well is due to quantum tunnelling. In the second scenario, the wave packet energy is above the barrier. Classical particles would then transfer to the other well without loss of density, yet this is again not true for the quantum world. The wave packet partially reflects on the barrier and some density remains in the original well.

To assess the amount of density transferred to the right well, we devise a coefficient $\kappa$ defined as
\begin{equation*}
    \kappa(t) = \int_0^{\infty} \psi^*(x,t) \psi(x,t) \dd x \,.
\end{equation*}
The value of $\kappa$ will tell us how big portion of the density is located in the right well, i.e. about the tunnelling efficiency in the first scenario and reflective strength in the second scenario.

\paragraph{Assignment:} Prepare a double well potential with parameters $m=20$~a.u. and $\omega=2$~a.u. First, initialize the dynamics with a wave function in form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:qdgauss} with parameters $x_0=-0.90$~a.u., $p_0=0$~a.u. and $\alpha_0 = 2m\omega$~a.u. (the energy of the wave packet should be below the barrier). Second, initialize the dynamics with parameters $x_0=-0.95$~a.u., $p_0=8$~a.u. and $\alpha_0=2m\omega$~a.u. (the energy should be above the barrier). Calculate the parameter $\kappa$ for both scenarios and compare them with your expectations base on classical physics. Analyse the dynamics also visually by plotting the density in time. Con you identify interferences of the reflected and tunnelled wave packets?

\subsection*{Exercise: Heisenberg's uncertainity relations}

The uncertainty principle developed by Werner Heisenberg is one of the corner stones of quantum mechanics. It states that
\begin{equation}
    \Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \, , 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
    \Delta x &= \braket{x^2} - \braket{x}^2 = \bra{\psi(x, t)}x^2\ket{\psi(x,t)} -  \bra{\psi(x, t)}x\ket{\psi(x,t)}^2\\
    \Delta p &= \braket{p^2} - \braket{p}^2 = \bra{\psi(x, t)}\hat{p}^2\ket{\psi(x,t)} -  \bra{\psi(x, t)}\hat{p}\ket{\psi(x,t)}^2 \, .
\end{align}
However, the uncertainty principle states only the lower boundary for $\Delta x \Delta p$ and does not tell us if it remains constant, rises or oscillates throughout the time evolution. The goal of this exercise is to empirically estimate whether the product $ \Delta x \Delta p$ remains constant in time or not. If not, how does it behave?

\paragraph{Assignment:} Evolve an arbitrary initial Gaussian wave packet in a harmonic oscillator and estimate the product $\Delta x \Delta p$ in time during the dynamics. Try the same also for a Morse potential and a double-well potential. Estimate how the product $\Delta x \Delta p$ behaves and if the behaviour differs between the potentials.
