This part provides an educational exploration into the computational techniques fundamental to understanding molecular electronic structure in quantum chemistry. Beginning with the \acrfull{hf} method, the text introduces this foundational approach for determining molecular orbitals and electronic energies by approximating the interactions of electrons through a mean-field approximation. The HF method forms the basis for subsequent methods and is presented with a practical coding exercise that guides readers in implementing and calculating \acrshort{hf} energies in Python.

Moving beyond HF, the text delves into \acrfull{mppt}, which improves \acrshort{hf} predictions by introducing corrections for electron correlation through a perturbative approach. This section includes exercises on calculating second- and third-order corrections, allowing readers to enhance their understanding of how electron interactions can be more accurately incorporated. \acrfull{ci} theory is then presented as an approach for representing the molecular wavefunction as a combination of electron configurations. Here, readers learn the theoretical basis of \acrshort{ci} and engage with practical examples focused on constructing the \acrshort{ci} Hamiltonian matrix and solving for molecular energies, particularly emphasizing \acrfull{fci} for high accuracy in small systems.

The part culminates with a discussion on the \acrfull{cc} theory, a highly accurate and computationally efficient method for capturing electron correlation effects, often used for small to medium-sized systems. By introducing truncations such as \acrfull{ccd} and \acrfull{ccsd}, the text demonstrates how electron correlation can be systematically included while balancing computational cost. The \acrshort{cc} section provides iterative coding exercises for calculating correlation energies, rounding out the document's comprehensive approach to electronic structure methods in computational quantum chemistry. Through this blend of theory, mathematical formulations, and hands-on coding exercises, the document serves as an invaluable resource for building a strong foundational understanding of electronic structure methods.
\chapter{Hartree--Fock Method}

The \acrshort{hf} method is a foundational approach in quantum chemistry, aimed at solving the electronic structure problem in molecules by determining an optimal wavefunction. This method simplifies the complex interactions of electrons through a mean-field approximation, where each electron moves in an average field created by all others. This allows for the use of a single set of orbitals, leading to the construction of the Fock operator and iterative solutions to one-electron equations.

However, \acrshort{hf} has notable limitations. Its reliance on a single-determinant wavefunction means it struggles to account for electron correlation. This leads to inaccuracies in energy predictions, particularly for systems with strong electron interactions, such as transition metal complexes or molecules with delocalized electrons.

\section{Theoretical Background}

Our primary objective is to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in the form

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}\ket{\Psi}=E\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\mathbf{H}}\) denotes the molecular Hamiltonian operator, \(\ket{\Psi}\) represents the molecular wavefunction, and \(E\) is the total energy of the system. The \acrshort{hf} approximates the total wavefunction \(\ket{\Psi}\) as a single Slater determinant, expressed as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi}=\ket{\chi_1\chi_2\cdots\chi_N}
\end{equation}

where \(\chi_i\) denotes a spin orbital, and \(N\) is the total number of electrons. The goal of the \acrshort{hf} method is to optimize these orbitals in order to minimize the system's total energy, thereby providing a reliable estimate of the electronic structure.

In the \acrfull{rhf} method, we impose a constraint on electron spin, which allows us to work with spatial orbitals instead of spin orbitals. This reformulation expresses the Slater determinant in terms of spatial orbitals as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi}=\ket{\Phi_1\Phi_2\cdots\Phi_{N/2}}
\end{equation}

where \(\Phi_i\) represents a spatial orbital. Notably, the \acrshort{rhf} method requires an even number of electrons to satisfy spin-pairing. In practice, atomic orbitals (whether spin or spatial) are typically expanded in a set of basis functions \(\left\lbrace\phi_i\right\rbrace\), which are often Gaussian functions, allowing for convenient computation with expansion coefficients. After performing some algebraic manipulations, the \acrshort{hf} method leads to the Roothaan equations, which are expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:roothaan}
\mathbf{FC}=\mathbf{SC}\bm{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the Fock matrix, \(\mathbf{C}\) is the matrix of orbital coefficients, \(\mathbf{S}\) is the overlap matrix, and \(\bm{\varepsilon}\) represents the orbital energies. These matrices will be defined in detail later.

\section{Implementation of the Restricted Hartree--Fock Method}

To begin, we define the core Hamiltonian, also known as the one-electron Hamiltonian. This component of the full Hamiltonian excludes electron-electron repulsion and is expressed in index notation as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hamiltonian}
H_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{core}}=T_{\mu\nu}+V_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

where \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) are indices of the basis functions. Here, \(T_{\mu\nu}\) represents a kinetic energy matrix element, while \(V_{\mu\nu}\) denotes a potential energy matrix element. These matrix elements are defined as

\begin{align}
T_{\mu\nu}&=\braket{\phi_{\mu}|\hat{T}|\phi_{\nu}} \\
V_{\mu\nu}&=\braket{\phi_{\mu}|\hat{V}|\phi_{\nu}}
\end{align}

Additionally, the overlap integrals, which describe the extent of overlap between basis functions, are given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlap}
S_{\mu\nu}=\braket{\phi_{\mu}|\phi_{\nu}}
\end{equation}

and another essential component are the two-electron repulsion integrals, defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:coulomb}
J_{\mu\nu\kappa\lambda}=\braket{\phi_{\mu}\phi_{\mu}|\hat{J}|\phi_{\kappa}\phi_{\lambda}}
\end{equation}

which play crucial roles in the \acrshort{hf} calculation. All of these integrals over (Gausssian) basis functions are usually calculated using analytical expressions.\cite{10.1016/S0065-3276!08!60019-2} The solution to the Roothaan equations \eqref{eq:roothaan} requires an iterative procedure, since the Fock matrix defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fock}
F_{\mu\nu}=H_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{core}}+D_{\kappa\lambda}\left(J_{\mu\nu\kappa\lambda}-\frac{1}{2}J_{\mu\lambda\kappa\nu}\right)
\end{equation}

depends on the unknown density matrix \(\mathbf{D}\), defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hf_density}
D_{\mu\nu}=2C_{\mu i}C_{\nu i}
\end{equation}

This iterative procedure is executed through the \acrfull{scf} method. An initial guess is made for the density matrix \(\mathbf{D}\) (usually zero), the Roothaan equations \eqref{eq:roothaan} are solved and the density matix is updated using the equation \eqref{eq:hf_density}. The total energy of the system is then calculated using the core Hamiltonian and the Fock matrix as

\begin{equation}
E=\frac{1}{2}D_{\mu\nu}(H_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{core}}+F_{\mu\nu})+E_{\mathrm{nuc}}
\end{equation}

After convergence of both the density matrix and total energy, the process concludes, yielding the optimized molecular orbitals. The total energy of the system also includes the nuclear repulsion energy, which is given by

\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{nuc}}=\sum_{A}\sum_{B<A}\frac{Z_{A}Z_{B}}{R_{AB}}
\end{equation}

where \(Z_A\) is the nuclear charge of atom \(A\), and \(R_{AB}\) is the distance between atoms \(A\) and \(B\).

\subsection{Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace}

In the \acrshort{hf} method, convergence of the density matrix and energy can be significantly accelerated by employing the \acrfull{diis} technique. \acrshort{diis} achieves this by storing Fock matrices from previous iterations and constructing an optimized linear combination that minimizes the current iteration's error. This approach is especially valuable in \acrshort{hf} calculations for large systems, where convergence issues are more common and challenging to resolve.

We start by defining the error vector of \(i\)-th iteration \(\mathbf{e}_i\) as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{e}_i=\mathbf{S}_i\mathbf{D}_i\mathbf{F}_i-\mathbf{F}_i\mathbf{D}_i\mathbf{S}_i
\end{equation}

Our goal is to transform the Fock matrix \(\mathbf{F}_i\) as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fock_extrapolate}
\mathbf{F}_i=\sum_{j=i-(L+1)}^{i-1}c_j\mathbf{F}_j
\end{equation}

where \(c_j\) are the coefficients that minimize the error matrix \(\mathbf{e}_i\) and \(L\) is the number of Fock matrices we store called the subspace size. To calculate the coefficients \(c_j\), we solve the set linear equations

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 & \dots & \mathbf{e}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_{L+1} & 1 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\mathbf{e}_{L+1}\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 & \dots & \mathbf{e}_{L+1}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{L+1} & 1 \\
1 & \dots & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
\vdots \\
c_{L+1} \\
\lambda \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
0 \\
1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

After solving the linear equations, we use the coefficients \(c_j\) to construct the new Fock matrix \(\mathbf{F}_i\) according to the equation \eqref{eq:fock_extrapolate} and proceed as usual with the \acrshort{hf} calculation.

\subsection{Gradient of the Restricted Hartree--Fock Method}

If we perform the calculation as described above and get the density matrix \(\mathbf{D}\) we can evaluate the nuclear energy gradient as\cite{10.1002/9780470749593.hrs006}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hf_gradient}
\end{equation}

where \(A\) is the index of an atom, \(i\) is the index of the coordinate, \(\left\lbrace\phi_A\right\rbrace\) is the set of all basis functions located at atom \(A\) and \(\mathbf{W}\) is energy weighed density matrix defined as

\begin{equation}
W_{\mu\nu}=2C_{\mu i}C_{\nu i}\varepsilon_i
\end{equation}

Keep in mind that the indices \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\) in the gradient equation \eqref{eq:hf_gradient} are summed over all basis functions.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Integral Transforms to the Basis of Molecular Spinorbitals\label{sec:integral_transform}}{Integral Transforms to the Basis of Molecular Spinorbitals}}

To carry out most \acrfull{post-hf} calculations, it is essential to transform the integrals into the \acrfull{ms} basis. We will outline this transformation process here and refer to it in subsequent sections on \acrshort{post-hf} methods. The \acrshort{post-hf} methods in this document will be presented using the integrals in the \acrshort{ms} basis (and in its antisymmetrized form for the two-electron integrals) as this approach is more general.

All the integrals defined in the equations \eqref{eq:hamiltonian}, \eqref{eq:overlap}, and \eqref{eq:coulomb}, as well as Fock matrix in the equation \eqref{eq:fock} are defined in the basis of atomic orbitals. To transform these integrals to the \acrshort{ms} basis, we utilize the coefficient matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) obtained from the solution of the Roothaan equations \eqref{eq:roothaan}. This coefficient matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) is initially calculated in the spatial molecular orbital basis (in the \acrshort{rhf} calculation).

The first step involves expanding the coefficient matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) to the \acrshort{ms} basis. This transformation can be mathematically expressed using the tiling matrix \(\mathbf{P}_{n\times 2n}\), defined as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P}=
\begin{pmatrix}
e_1&e_1&e_2&e_2&\dots&e_n&e_n
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where \(e_i\) represents the \(i\)-th column of the identity matrix \(\mathbf{I}_n\). Additionally, we define the matrices \(\mathbf{M}_{n\times 2n}\) and \(\mathbf{N}_{n\times 2n}\) with elements given by

\begin{equation}
M_{ij}=1-j\bmod 2,N_{ij}=j \bmod 2
\end{equation}

The coefficient matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) in the \acrshort{ms} basis can be then expressed as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{MS}}=
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{CP} \\
\mathbf{CP}
\end{pmatrix}
\odot
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{M} \\
\mathbf{N}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where \(\odot\) denotes the Hadamard product. This transformed matrix \(\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{MS}}\) is subsequently used to transform the two-electron integrals \(\mathbf{J}\) to the \acrshort{ms} basis as

\begin{equation}
J_{pqrs}^{\mathrm{MS}}=C_{\mu p}^{\mathrm{MS}}C_{\nu q}^{\mathrm{MS}}(\mathbf{I}_{2}\otimes_K(\mathbf{I}_{2}\otimes_K\mathbf{J})^{(4,3,2,1)})_{\mu\nu\kappa\lambda}C_{\kappa r}^{\mathrm{MS}}C_{\lambda s}^{\mathrm{MS}}
\end{equation}

where the superscript \((4,3,2,1)\) denotes the axes transposition and \(\otimes_K\) is the Kronecker product. This notation accommodates the spin modifications and ensures adherence to quantum mechanical principles. We also define the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals in physicists' notation as

\begin{equation}
\braket{pq||rs}=(J_{pqrs}^{\mathrm{MS}}-J_{psrq}^{\mathrm{MS}})^{(1,3,2,4)}
\end{equation}

For the transformation of the one-electron integrals such as the core Hamiltonian, the overlap matrix and also the Fock matrix, we use the formula

\begin{equation}
A_{pq}^{\mathrm{MS}}=C_{\mu p}^{\mathrm{MS}}(\mathbf{I}_{2}\otimes_K\mathbf{A})_{\mu\nu}C_{\nu q}^{\mathrm{MS}}
\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{A}\) is an arbitrary matrix of one-electron integrals. Since many \acrshort{post-hf} methods rely on differences of orbital energies in the denominator, we define the tensors

\begin{align}
\varepsilon^{a}_{i}&=\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_a \\
\varepsilon^{ab}_{ij}&=\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b \\
\varepsilon^{abc}_{ijk}&=\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j+\varepsilon_k-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b-\varepsilon_c
\end{align}

for convenience. These tensors enhance code readability and efficiency, making it easier to understand and work with the underlying mathematical framework. Here and also throughout the rest of the document, the indices \(i\), \(j\) and \(k\) run over occupied orbitals, whereas the indices \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) run over virtual orbitals.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Hartree--Fock Method and Integral Transform Coding Exercise\label{sec:hf_int_code_exercise}}{Hartree--Fock Method and Integral Transform Coding Exercise}}

This section provides Python code snippets for implementing the \acrshort{hf} method and transforming integrals to the \acrshort{ms} basis.

The \texttt{\lstinline!ATOM!} variable is a dictionary that maps the atomic symbols to atomic numbers.

\chapter{M√∏ller--Plesset Perturbation Theory}

\acrshort{mppt} is a quantum mechanical method used to improve the accuracy of electronic structure calculations within the framework of \acrshort{hf} theory. It involves treating electron-electron correlation effects as a perturbation to the reference \acrshort{hf} wave function. The method is named after its developers, physicists C. M√∏ller and M. S. Plesset. By systematically including higher-order corrections, \acrshort{mppt} provides more accurate predictions of molecular properties compared to the initial \acrshort{hf} approximation.

\section{Theory of the Perturbative Approach}

As for the \acrshort{hf} method, we start with the Schr√∂dinger equation in the form

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}\ket{\Psi}=E\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\mathbf{H}}\) is the molecular Hamiltonian operator, \(\ket{\Psi}\) is the molecular wave function, and \(E\) is the total energy of the system. In the M√∏ller--Plesset perturbation theory we write the Hamiltonian operator as

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}=\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{(0)}+\lambda\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{'}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{(0)}\) is the Hamiltonian used in the \acrshort{hf} method (representing electrons moving in the mean field), \(\lambda\) is a parameter between 0 and 1, and \(\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{'}\) is the perturbation operator representing the missing electron-electron interactions not included in the \acrshort{hf} approximation. We then expand the wavefunction \(\ket{\Psi}\) and total energy \(E\) as a power series in \(\lambda\) as

\begin{align}
\ket{\Psi}&=\ket{\Psi^{(0)}}+\lambda\ket{\Psi^{(1)}}+\lambda^2\ket{\Psi^{(2)}}+\dots \\
E&=E^{(0)}+\lambda E^{(1)}+\lambda^2 E^{(2)}+\dots
\end{align}

and ask, how how does the total energy change with the included terms. After some algebra, we can show that the first order correction to the total energy is zero, the second order correction is given by

\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{corr}}^{\mathrm{MP2}}=\sum_{s>0}\frac{H_{0s}^{'}H_{s0}^{'}}{E_0-E_s}
\end{equation}

where \(s\) runs over all doubly excited determinants, \(H_{0s}^{'}\) is the matrix element of the perturbation operator between the \acrshort{hf} determinant and the doubly excited determinant, and \(E_0\) and \(E_s\) are the energies of the reference and doubly excited determinants, respectively.\cite{10.1002/wcms.58,1014569052} We could express all higher-order corrections in a similar way, using only the matrix elements of the perturbation operator and the energies of the determinants. For practical calculations, we apply Slater-Condon rules to evaluate the matrix elements and use the orbital energies obtained from the Hartree-Fock calculation. The expressions for calculation are summarised below.

\section{Implementation of 2nd and 3rd Order Corrections}

Having the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals in the \acrshort{ms} basis and physicists' notation defined in Section \ref{sec:integral_transform}, we can now proceed with the calculation of the correlation energy. The 2nd order correlation energy can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{corr}}^{\mathrm{MP2}}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{ij||ab}}{\varepsilon_{ij}^{ab}}
\end{equation}

and the 3rd order correlation energy as

\begin{align}
E_{\mathrm{corr}}^{\mathrm{MP3}}=&\frac{1}{8}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{cd||ab}\braket{ij||cd}}{\varepsilon_{ij}^{ab}\varepsilon_{ij}^{cd}}+\nonumber \\
&+\frac{1}{8}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{ij||kl}\braket{kl||ab}}{\varepsilon_{ij}^{ab}\varepsilon_{kl}^{ab}}+\nonumber \\
&+\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{cj||kb}\braket{ik||ac}}{\varepsilon_{ij}^{ab}\varepsilon_{ik}^{ac}}
\end{align}

To calculate the 4th order correction, we would need to write 39 terms, which is not practical. Higher-order corrections are usually not programmed this way, instead, the diagrammatic approach is used.\cite{1014569052,10.1016/0010-4655!73!90016-7,10.1016/0010-4655!73!90017-9}

\chapter{Configuration Interaction}

\acrshort{ci} is a \acrshort{post-hf}, utilizing a linear variational approach to address the nonrelativistic Schr√∂dinger equation under the Born--Oppenheimer approximation for multi-electron quantum systems. \acrshort{ci} mathematically represents the wave function as a linear combination of Slater determinants. The term ``configuration'' refers to different ways electrons can occupy orbitals, while ``interaction'' denotes the mixing of these electronic configurations or states. \acrshort{ci} computations, however, are resource-intensive, requiring significant CPU time and memory, limiting their application to smaller molecular systems. While \acrshort{fci} considers all possible electronic configurations, making it computationally prohibitive for larger systems, truncated versions like \acrfull{cisd} or \acrfull{cisdt} are more feasible and commonly employed in quantum chemistry studies.

\section{Theoretical Background of General Configuration Interaction}

In \acrshort{ci} theory, we expand the wavefunction \(\ket{\Psi}\) in terms of the \acrshort{hf} reference determinant and its excited configurations as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi}=c_0\ket{\Psi_0}+\left(\frac{1}{1!}\right)^2c_i^a\ket{\Psi_i^a}+\left(\frac{1}{2!}\right)^2c_{ij}^{ab}\ket{\Psi_{ij}^{ab}}+\left(\frac{1}{3!}\right)^2c_{ijk}^{abc}\ket{\Psi_{ijk}^{abc}}+\dots
\end{equation}

where we seek the coefficients \(\mathbf{c}\) that minimize the energy. To determine these coefficients, we construct and diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of these excited determinants. The \acrshort{ci} Hamiltonian matrix \(\mathbf{H}^{\mathrm{CI}}\) is represented as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ci-hamiltonian}
\mathbf{H}^{\mathrm{CI}}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\braket{\Psi_0|\hat{H}|\Psi_0} & \braket{\Psi_0|\hat{H}|\Psi_i^a} & \braket{\Psi_0|\hat{H}|\Psi_{ij}^{ab}} & \dots \\
\braket{\Psi_i^a|\hat{H}|\Psi_0} & \braket{\Psi_i^a|\hat{H}|\Psi_i^a} & \braket{\Psi_i^a|\hat{H}|\Psi_{ij}^{ab}} & \dots \\
\braket{\Psi_{ia}^{jb}|\hat{H}|\Psi_0} & \braket{\Psi_{ia}^{jb}|\hat{H}|\Psi_1} & \braket{\Psi_{ia}^{jb}|\hat{H}|\Psi_{ia}^{jb}} & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

After the Hamiltonian matrix is constructed, we solve the eigenvalue problem

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ci-eigenvalue-problem}
\mathbf{H}^{\mathrm{CI}}\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{CI}}=\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{CI}}\bm{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{CI}}
\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{CI}}\) is a matrix of coefficients and \(\bm{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{CI}}\) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The lowest eigenvalue gives the ground-state energy, and the corresponding eigenvector provides the coefficients that minimize the energy. The elements of the \acrshort{ci} Hamiltonian matrix are computed using the Slater--Condon rules, summarized in one function as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:slater-condon-rules}
\mathbf{H}_{ij}^{\mathrm{CI}}=
\begin{cases} 
\displaystyle \sum_kH_{kk}^{\mathrm{core},\mathrm{MS}}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_k\sum_l\braket{kl||kl}&D_i=D_j \\
\displaystyle H_{pr}^{\mathrm{core},\mathrm{MS}}+\sum_k\braket{pk||lk}&D_i=\left\lbrace\dotsi p\dotsi\right\rbrace\land D_j=\left\lbrace\dotsi r\dotsi\right\rbrace \\
\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum_k}\braket{pq||rs}&D_i=\left\lbrace\dotsi p\dotsi q\dotsi\right\rbrace\land D_j=\left\lbrace\dotsi r\dotsi s\dotsi\right\rbrace \\
\displaystyle \vphantom{\sum_k}0&\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where \(D_i\) and \(D_j\) are Slater determinants, \(\mathbf{H}^{\mathrm{core},\mathrm{MS}}\) is the core Hamiltonian in the \acrshort{ms} basis, and \(\braket{pk||lk}\) are the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals in \acrshort{ms} basis and physicists' notation. The sums extend over all spinorbitals common between the two determinants. These integrals were previously transformed in Section \ref{sec:integral_transform}. Keep in mind, that to apply the Slater-Condon rules, the determinants must be aligned, and the sign of the matrix elements must be adjusted accordingly, based on the number of permutations needed to align the determinants.

An important caveat in \acrshort{ci} theory is its lack of size-extensivity, which implies that the energy does not scale linearly with the number of electrons. This drawback stems from the fact that the \acrshort{ci} wavefunction is not size-consistent, meaning the energy of a combined system is not simply the sum of the energies of its isolated parts. This limitation restricts the application of \acrshort{ci} mainly to small molecular systems.

\section{Full Configuration Interaction Implementation}

In \acrshort{fci}, we aim to account for all possible electronic configurations within a chosen basis set, offering the most accurate wavefunction representation for the given basis. Although this method yields highly precise electronic structure information, it is computationally intensive. Its cost scales exponentially with both the number of electrons and basis functions, limiting its feasibility to smaller systems.

The \acrshort{fci} process involves constructing all possible Slater determinants for a system. For simplicity, we'll assume that we want to include both singlet and triplet states in our determinant space. The total number of these determinants \(N_D\) can be calculated using binomial coefficients

\begin{equation}
N_D=\binom{n}{k}
\end{equation}

where \(k\) is the total number of electrons, and \(n\) is the total number of spinorbitals. For practical representation, it's useful to describe determinants as arrays of numbers, where each number corresponds to the index of an occupied orbitals. For example, the ground state determinant for a system with 6 electrons can be represented as \(\left\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5\right\rbrace\), whereas the determinant \(\left\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,6\right\rbrace\) represents an excited state with one electron excited from orbital 5 to orbital 6. Using the determinants, the \acrshort{ci} Hamiltonian matrix \eqref{eq:ci-hamiltonian} can be constructed, and the eigenvalue problem \eqref{eq:ci-eigenvalue-problem} can be solved to obtain the ground and excited state energies.

\section{Full Configuration Interaction Code Exercise}

The \acrshort{fci} example builds on the \acrshort{hf} method and demonstrates how to implement a \acrshort{fci} calculation in Python using NumPy. This exercise focuses on generating determinants, constructing the \acrshort{ci} Hamiltonian matrix using Slater--Condon rules, and solving the eigenvalue problem to obtain the ground state energy. The code is designed for educational purposes and is based on prior \acrshort{hf} results that can be done in Section \ref{sec:hf_int_code_exercise}. The exercise is provided in the Listing \ref{code:ci_exercise} below.

Since we already calculated the necessary integrals in the MS basis, we can proceed. The next step involves generating determinants. We will store these in a simple list, with each determinant represented by an array of numbers, where each number corresponds to an occupied spinorbital. Since we are programming for Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), we aim to generate all possible determinants. However, should we decide to implement methods like CIS, CID, or CISD, we could easily limit the number of excitations. It is important to remember that for all CI methods, the rest of the code remains unchanged. The only difference lies in the determinants used. Don't overcomplicate this. Generating all possible determinants can be efficiently achieved using a simple list comprehension. I recommend employing the combinations function from the itertools package to facilitate this task.

Before we begin constructing the Hamiltonian, I recommend defining the Slater-Condon rules. Let's consider that the input for these functions will be an array of spinorbitals, segmented into unique and common ones. A practical approach might be to arrange this 1D array with all unique spinorbitals at the front, followed by the common spinorbitals. This arrangement allows you to easily determine the number of unique spinorbitals based on the rule being applied, meaning you will always know how many entries at the beginning of the array are unique spinorbitals. While you can develop your own method for managing this array, I will proceed under the assumption that the Slater-Condon rules we use will take a single array of spinorbitals and return an unsigned matrix element. The sign of this element will be corrected later in the script. For simplicity and flexibility, I'll define these rules using lambda functions, but you're welcome to expand them into full functions if you prefer.

Instead, we carry out the next steps on the determinant now contained in the "aligned" variable. Additionally, the element sign is defined at this stage. You probably want to leave this unchanged.

It's also important to monitor the number of swaps you make, as each swap affects the sign of the determinant, hence the reason for the "sign" variable defined earlier. This task is not straightforward, so don't hesitate to reach out to the authors if you need guidance.

\chapter{Coupled Cluster Theory}

\acrshort{cc} theory is a \acrshort{post-hf} method used in quantum chemistry to achieve highly accurate solutions to the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation, particularly for ground states and certain excited states. It improves upon \acrshort{hf} by incorporating electron correlation effects through a systematic inclusion of excitations (singles, doubles, triples, etc.) from a reference wavefunction, usually the \acrshort{hf} wavefunction. The method uses an exponential ansatz to account for these excitations, leading to a size-consistent and size-extensive approach, making it one of the most accurate methods available for small to medium-sized molecular systems.

Within \acrshort{cc} theory, specific truncations are often applied to manage computational cost. The \acrshort{ccd} method considers only double excitations, capturing electron correlation more effectively than simpler methods like \acrshort{hf}, but at a lower computational expense than higher-level methods. \acrshort{ccsd} extends this approach by including both single and double excitations, offering greater accuracy, particularly for systems where single excitations play a significant role. \acrshort{ccsd} is widely used due to its balance between accuracy and computational feasibility, making it a reliable choice for many chemical systems. \#\# \acrshort{cc} Formalism

In the \acrshort{cc} formalism, we write the total wavefunction in an exponential form as

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi}=e^{\hat{\mathbf{T}}}\ket{\Psi_0}
\end{equation}

where \(\ket{\Psi_0}\) is the reference wavefunction, usually the \acrshort{hf} wavefunction, and \(\hat{T}\) is the cluster operator that generates excitations from the reference wavefunction. The cluster operator is defined as

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{T}}=\hat{\mathbf{T}}_1+\hat{\mathbf{T}}_2+\hat{\mathbf{T}}_3+\dots
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\mathbf{T}}_1\) generates single excitations, \(\hat{\mathbf{T}}_2\) generates double excitations, and so on. For example

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{T}}_1\ket{\Psi_0}=\left(\frac{1}{1!}\right)^2t_i^a\ket{\Psi_i^a}
\end{equation}

where \(t_i^a\) are the single excitation amplitudes. These amplitudes are just expansion coefficients that determine the contribution of each excitation to the total wavefunction. In the context of configuration interaction, we denoted these coefficients as \(c_i^a\). Now that we have the total wavefunction, we want to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}\ket{\Psi}=E\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{H}\) is the molecular Hamiltonian operator, \(E\) is the total energy of the system, and \(\ket{\Psi}\) is the total wavefunction. In the \acrshort{cc} theory, we usually rewrite the Schr√∂dinger equation in the exponential form as

\begin{equation}
e^{-\hat{\mathbf{T}}}\hat{\mathbf{H}}e^{\hat{\mathbf{T}}}\ket{\Psi_0}=E\ket{\Psi_0}
\end{equation}

because we can then express the \acrshort{cc} energy as

\begin{equation}
E=\braket{\Psi_0|e^{-\hat{\mathbf{T}}}\hat{\mathbf{H}}e^{\hat{\mathbf{T}}}|\Psi_0}
\end{equation}

taking advantage of the exponential form of the wavefunction. We could then proceed to express the total energy for various \acrshort{cc} methods like \acrshort{ccd} and \acrshort{ccsd}, but the equations would be quite lengthy. Instead, we will leave the theory here and proceed to the actual calculations. One thing to keep in mind is that the \acrshort{cc} equations are nonlinear and require iterative solution methods to obtain the final amplitudes.

\section{Implementation of Truncated Coupled Cluster Methods}

We will not go into the details here, but we will provide the final expressions for the \acrshort{ccd} and \acrshort{ccsd} methods.\cite{10.1063/1.460620} The \acrshort{ccd} and \acrshort{ccsd} methods are the most commonly used \acrshort{cc} methods, and they are often used as benchmarks for other methods. All we need for the evaluation of the expressions below are the two-electron integrals in the \acrshort{ms} basis and physicists' notation, Fock matrix in the \acrshort{ms} basis and the orbital energy tensors obtained from the \acrshort{hf} calculation. All these transformations are already explained in Section \ref{sec:integral_transform}. The expressions for the \acrshort{ccd} can be written as

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{CCD}}=\frac{1}{4}\braket{ij||ab}t_{ij}^{ab}
\end{equation}

where the double excitation amplitudes \(t_{ij}^{ab}\) are determined by solving the \acrshort{ccd} amplitude equation. The \acrshort{ccd} amplitude equations are given by

\begin{align}
t_{ij}^{ab}=&\braket{ab||ij}+\frac{1}{2}\braket{ab||cd}t_{cd}^{ij}+\frac{1}{2}\braket{kl||ij}t_{ab}^{kl}+\hat{P}_{(a/b)}\hat{P}_{(i/j)}\braket{ak||ic}t_{cb}^{ij}-\nonumber \\
&-\frac{1}{2}\hat{P}_{(a/b)}\braket{kl||cd}t_{ac}^{ij}t_{bd}^{kl}-\frac{1}{2}\hat{P}_{(i/j)}\braket{kl||cd}t_{ab}^{ik}t_{cd}^{jl}+\nonumber \\
&+\frac{1}{4}\braket{kl||cd}t_{cd}^{ij}t_{ab}^{kl}+\hat{P}_{(i/j)}\braket{kl||cd}t_{ac}^{ik}t_{bd}^{jl}
\end{align}

where \(\hat{P}_{(a/b)}\) and \(\hat{P}_{(i/j)}\) are permutation operators that ensure the correct antisymmetry of the amplitudes. The \acrshort{ccsd} energy expression is given by

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{CCSD}}=F_{ia}^{\mathrm{MS}}t_a^i+\frac{1}{4}\braket{ij||ab}t_{ij}^{ab}+\frac{1}{2}\braket{ij||ab}t_{i}^{a}t_{b}^{j}
\end{equation}

where the single and double excitation amplitudes \(t_a^i\) and \(t_{ij}^{ab}\) are determined by solving the \acrshort{ccsd} amplitude equations. To simplify the notation a little bit, we define the the \(\mathscr{F}\) and \(\mathscr{W}\) intermediates as

\begin{align}
\mathscr{F}_{ae}=&\left(1-\delta_{ae}\right)F_{ae}-\frac{1}{2}F_{me}t_m^a+t_m^f\braket{ma||fe}-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\tau}_{mn}^{af}\braket{mn||ef} \\
\mathscr{F}_{mi}=&\left(1-\delta_{mi}\right)F_{mi}+\frac{1}{2}F_{me}t_i^e+t_n^e\braket{mn||ie}+\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\tau}_{in}^{ef}\braket{mn||ef} \\
\mathscr{F}_{me}=&F_{me}+t_n^f\braket{mn||ef} \\
\mathscr{W}_{mnij}=&\braket{mn||ij}+\hat{P}_{(i/j)}t_j^e\braket{mn||ie}+\frac{1}{4}\tau_{ij}^{ef}\braket{mn||ef} \\
\mathscr{W}_{abef}=&\braket{ab||ef}-\hat{P}_{(a/b)}t_m^b\braket{am||ef}+\frac{1}{4}\tau_{mn}^{ab}\braket{mn||ef} \\
\mathscr{W}_{mbej}=&\braket{mb||ej}+t_j^f\braket{mb||ef}-t_n^b\braket{mn||ej}-\left(\frac{1}{2}t_{jn}^{fb}+t_j^ft_n^b\right)\braket{mn||ef}
\end{align}

and two-particle excitation operators as

\begin{align}
\tilde{\tau}_{ij}^{ab}=&t_{ij}^{ab}+\frac{1}{2}\left(t_i^at_j^b-t_i^bt_j^a\right) \\
\tau_{ij}^{ab}=&t_{ij}^{ab}+t_i^at_j^b-t_i^bt_j^a
\end{align}

The \acrshort{ccsd} single excitations amplitude equations are then given by

\begin{align}
t_i^a=&F_{ai}^{\mathrm{MS}}+t_i^e\mathscr{F}_{ae}-t_m^a\mathscr{F}_{mi}t_{im}^{ae}\mathscr{F}_{me}-t_n^f\braket{na||if}-\nonumber-\frac{1}{2}t_{im}^{ef}\braket{ma||ef}- \\
&-\frac{1}{2}t_{mn}^{ae}\braket{nm||ei}
\end{align}

and the \acrshort{ccsd} double excitations amplitude equations are given by

\begin{align}
t_{ij}^{ab}=&\braket{ab||ij}+\hat{P}_{(a/b)}t_{ij}^{ae}\left(\mathscr{F}_{be}-\frac{1}{2}t_m^b\mathscr{F}_{ae}\right)-\hat{P}_{(i/j)}t_{im}^{ab}\left(\mathscr{F}_{mi}+\frac{1}{2}t_j^e\mathscr{F}_{me}\right)+\nonumber \\
&+\frac{1}{2}\tau_{mn}^{ab}\mathscr{W}_{mnij}+\frac{1}{2}\tau_{ij}^{ef}\mathscr{W}_{abef}+\hat{P}_{(i/j)}\hat{P}_{(a/b)}\left(t_{im}^{ae}\mathscr{W}_{mbej}-t_i^et_m^a\braket{mb||ej}\right)+\nonumber \\
&+\hat{P}_{(i/j)}t_i^e\braket{ab||ej}-\hat{P}_{(a/b)}t_m^a\braket{mb||ij}
\end{align}

The \acrshort{ccsd} amplitude equations are, again, nonlinear and require iterative solution methods to obtain the final amplitudes. The initial guess for the amplitudes is often set to zero, and the equations are solved iteratively until convergence is achieved.

\section{Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles Code Exercise}

After completing the \acrshort{hf} implementation in Section \ref{sec:hf_int_code_exercise}, you can proceed with coding the \acrshort{ccsd} exercise, which builds on the \acrshort{hf} results. The exercise is provided in the Listing \ref{code:cc_exercise} below.
